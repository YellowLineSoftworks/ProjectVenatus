The new game from YLS.

We've decided to make a basic RPG/Tower Defence game to improve our game development skills and in order to have a program with which to display our coding abilities. It is intended to be as simple as possible, while still implementing all of the basic RPG elements, some TD elements, and certain unique elements that we have yet to decide on. We want it to be fun to play, but the main purpose of this game is as a showcase and as practice.

This is our first game using GitHub as a collaboration base. So far, so good.
